This project provides the code to make an Beacon with an ESP32 board. The beacon is a small, low-power device that broadcasts a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal that can be picked up by nearby devices. The code provided in this project is written in C and can be flashed onto the ESP32 board using the VS Code.
